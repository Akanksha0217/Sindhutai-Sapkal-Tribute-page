    <h3><u>Early life</u></h3>
    <p>
      Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948, in Pipri Meghe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardha_district">Wardha district</a>  in
      the then Central Provinces and Berar of Dominion of India to <base>Abhimanyu Sathe</base>
     , a cowherder. Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as
      Chindhi (Marathi for "piece of rag"). Abject poverty, family
      responsibilities and childhood marriage to an older man forced her to quit
      formal education after she successfully passed the fourth standard.
      Sapkal was married off at age 12 to <b>Shrihari Sapkal</b>, who was 20 years
      older than her, and moved to Nawargaon, Seloo in Wardha. The marriage did
      not last long and at the age of 20, she was violently forced out of her
      home by her husband, leaving her on her own to care for a daughter
    </p>

    <h3><u>Early work with Adivasis</u></h3>
    <p><b>Sindhutai Sapkal</b> later found herself in Chikhaldara, where she started begging for food. In the process, she realised that there were many children abandoned by their parents and she adopted them as her own. She had to beg even harder to feed ever the larger family. She decided to become a mother to everyone who came across to her as an orphan. She later gave away her own daughter to the Shrimant Dagdu Sheth Halwai trust of Pune, to eliminate the feeling of partiality between her own child and the adopted children</p>
    <p>Sapkal fought for the rehabilitation of eighty-four villages. In the course of her agitation, she met Chhedilal Gupta, the then Minister of Forests. He agreed that the villagers should not be displaced before the government had made appropriate arrangements at alternative sites. When Prime Minister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>  arrived to inaugurate the <mark> tiger project</mark> , Sapkal showed her photographs of an Adivasi who had lost his eyes to a wild bear. She is quoted as saying,<i> "I told her that the forest department paid compensation if a cow or a hen was killed by a wild animal, so why not a human being? She immediately ordered compensation."</i></p>
